# KMeans Clustering Implementation in Python
Implementation of KMeans Clustering Algorithm in Python from scratch. This algorithm is commonly used in AI and Data Science for unsupervised learning.

This repository contains two files with the KMeans algorithm. One uses a simple centroid initialization done randomly and the other uses a slightly different variant of randomization depending on the max and minimum feature value.

The output of both of the implementation are included as well.
